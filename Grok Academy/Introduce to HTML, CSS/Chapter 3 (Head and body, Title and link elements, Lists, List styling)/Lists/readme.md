# Another kind of element
Time to do your science homework! You have to learn a list of familiar chemicals and their formulas.

A chemical formula contains element symbols from the [periodic table](https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/). For example, **H** is [Hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), **O** is [Oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), and **Cl** is [Chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine).

If an element occurs more than once in a chemical formula, then a subscript indicates how many times. For example, water is made up of two hydrogen and one oxygen atoms, so is written: **H<sub>2</sub>O**.

Your science teacher has published a web page to study from. Unfortunately, they don't know about HTML lists or subscripts, so they've just used a paragraph and line breaks.

Fix the page so that it is easier to read and better HTML by:

* replacing the **p** and **br** with an unordered list and items;
* highlighting each formula with **strong** (not including spaces);
* subscripting the numbers in each formula using **sub**.
