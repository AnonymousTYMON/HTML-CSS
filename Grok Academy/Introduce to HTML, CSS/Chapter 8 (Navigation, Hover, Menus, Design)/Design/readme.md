# inTRIPid
Alright everyone, this is the big one! There are many elements to style in this page and so attention to detail will be important.

We're going to style our inTRIPid travel site from top to bottom, using many of the things you've learnt from this module, and the rest of this course!

Use the asterisk: * { box-sizing: border-box; } but make sure it comes after any @import lines!
