# Good Sir, I Cannot Draw
Webcomic site **Good Sir, I Cannot Draw** by MatthewJA is being redesigned by you! And the most important part is the navigation that helps you read through each comic.

Some styles are already there for you, but the navigation bar needs some work. Don't touch the footer styles though!

## Don't use classes
We will be testing for extra class attributes in the HTML. You do not need to add any class attributes for this question; use child selectors.

Styling the nav bar
Make the nav background colour rgb(110, 23, 65);
the ul element in the nav bar should have 0 padding;
put all nav bar li list item elements onto one line using inline-block;
give all nav bar li list item elements, 10 pixels of padding on the top and bottom, and 30 pixels of padding on the left and right;
the links in the nav bar list should be white and have no underline.

The result should look like this:
