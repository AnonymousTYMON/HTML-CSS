# Shakespeare
Here's a page of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, but it's hard to read because the lines are clumped together and the name of who's speaking isn't clear.

Make this text into a full HTML document, so it's easy for the actors to read.

Each paragraph (separated by a blank line) should be a separate paragraph element, and you should use the <br> tag to break up the lines inside a paragraph.

At the beginning of each character's lines, the character name (and the colon) should be in a strong element. Any stage directions (in parentheses or round brackets â€“ like these!) should be in an em element, including the parentheses.
