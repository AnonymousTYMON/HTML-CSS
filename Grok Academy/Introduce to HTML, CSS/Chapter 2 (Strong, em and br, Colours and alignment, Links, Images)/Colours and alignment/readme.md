Kermit is experimenting with what shade of green to make the title of his new website, featuring himself.

Each line should be a *heading level 1* element and contain two span elements, and they should be center aligned.

On the left side you should start with black **rgb(0, 0, 0)**, increasing the green value by 40 each line until you reach a bright green **rgb(0, 240, 0)**.

On the right side, start with a very pale green **rgb(240, 255, 240)** and decrease the red and blue numbers by 40 each time until you reach **rgb(0, 255, 0)**.
