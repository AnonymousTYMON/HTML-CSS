# Holiday Blog
Here's a blog post talking about a holiday in Rome, but it would be much better with pictures.

## Images
* The hero image, **hero.jpg**, should be 100% of the width of the page.
* The four small images should all be 150 pixels high, and placed together inside a paragraph element.
*  The last image, **lion.jpg**, should be 700 pixels wide and placed inside a paragraph element.
## Image alt-text
The images must have the following **alt** text:

* Cropped triangular front of the Pantheon in Rome.
* Inside the ruin of the Colosseum with bear wearing gladiator helmet.
* The Trevi Fountain.
* Outside view of the Pantheon.
* Inside, looking up at the domed ceiling of the Pantheon.
* Statue of a lion with a small bird on the head.
* Text styling and layout
* Make the heading centred.
* Make the paragraphs 700 pixels wide, and centre them using margins.
* Make the line height 1.6x the size of the text (both paragraphs and heading).
* Paragraphs should have a top and bottom margin of 30 pixels.
* Paragraphs should have a font size of 20 pixels.
* Headings should not set a margin or font size (use the default).
