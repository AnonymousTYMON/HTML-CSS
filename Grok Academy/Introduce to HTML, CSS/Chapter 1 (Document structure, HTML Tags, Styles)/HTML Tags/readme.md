# True Blue
What is true blue? That is, which blue colour is best for a heading? One way to decide is to display lots of them at once.

The h1 elements in the HTML have the name of different blue colours from the [Cascading Style Sheet Color Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#svg-color). The names sound a bit like a paint catalogue!
