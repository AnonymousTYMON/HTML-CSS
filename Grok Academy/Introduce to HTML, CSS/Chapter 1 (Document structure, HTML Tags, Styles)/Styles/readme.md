#Monospacious
Styling the text of a webpage is critical to the design; choice of margins, spacing and font can make text much easier and pleasanter to read.

Add a **<style>** element to this page, and set the following properties inside it:

* The paragraph text should be 680 pixels wide;
* The paragraph text and heading should have 30 pixels bottom margins and 40 pixels left margins;
* The heading should also have a 30 pixel top margin;
* The paragraph line height should be 1.8 times the height of the text;
* The paragraph font size should be 18 pixels, and the heading should be twice that;
* The heading should use the font family **Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif**
* Paragraphs should use the font family **Georgia, Times, serif**
* The span should use the font family <font color="green">'Courier New'</font>, monospace

The result should look like this:
