# Athlete's Footer
Your local shoe store is redesigning their website for the end of financial year sale, and they can't get their footer look quite right. They've asked you to style the footer as follows:

## Don't use classes
You must not add any class attributes for this question, use child selectors. The automarker will reject extra **class** attributes.

## The footer element:
* Set the text to be center aligned;
* set the background colour to be **rgb(75, 75, 75)**;
* set the colour of the copyright message to be white.
## The list in the footer:
* Set the list itself and the list items to be **display**: **inline-block** so that the list items and the copyright text are all on the same line;
* set the list items to have 10 pixels of padding on all sides;
* set the colour of the links in the footer to be the same as the page header: **rgb(255, 112, 0)**.

The result should look like this:
