# Hook, Line and Header
The good folks over at the Argleton Aquarium are worried that their website doesn't get enough attention, and they think a new shiny header will help!

## Add a header element
The first **h1** and **h2** headings should go inside the header.

## Add some styles for the header element
Center text align the headings;
give the **header** 50px of padding on all sides;
make it 250 pixels high;
use the **aquarium_hero.jpg** image as a background;
use the [Slackey](https://fonts.google.com/#UsePlace:use/Collection:Slackey) (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Slackey) web font for the **header**
(we've already imported it for you at the top).

The result should look like this:
