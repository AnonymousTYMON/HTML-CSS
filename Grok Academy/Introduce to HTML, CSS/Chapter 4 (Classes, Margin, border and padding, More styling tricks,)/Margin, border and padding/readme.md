# Unread Notifications
Help Nick make his social notifications easier to read!

## Have a look at index.html
You don't need to change any of the HTML for this question, but have a look at it. There are 3 paragraphs with the class **unread**. All of the names of people and events have the class **name**, and all of the timestamps have the class **timestamp**.

## Write your styles in main.css:
* All paragraphs should have a width of 400px, with padding of 16px on all sides and margins set to 0;
* All paragraphs should have **1px solid lightgray** bottom and right border (no border on top and left sides);
＊　Spans with a **name** class should have a bold font weight;
＊ Spans with a **timestamp** class should have text colour **darkgray**;
* Paragraphs with an **unread** class should have background colour **rgb(237, 239, 245)**.

The result should look like this:
