# Mmm... Brownies
Your brownies are so delicious that people keep asking you for the recipe, so you've decided to share it online. Style your recipe so it looks as good as the brownies it makes. You don't need to change **index.html**.

## Body element
* Set width to 450px.
* Set the padding to 15px on the top and bottom and 35px on the left and right.
* Set the margin to 20px on the top and bottom and **auto** on the left and right.
* Add a **20px solid aliceblue** border.
* Set the **font-family** to **serif**.
## Headings
Apply the following styles to both the level 1 and level 2 headings.

* Centre align the text.
* Make all of the text uppercase.
* Set the font weight to 100.
* Set the padding to 5px on the top and bottom and 0 on the left and right.
* Add a **1px dotted gray** border on the top and bottom.
## Other things
* Change the list style for the ingredients to circle.
* Set the image width to be 100% (you've seen this in Holiday Blog!).

The result should look like this:
