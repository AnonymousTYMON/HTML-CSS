# Keep calm and code on
Can you code under pressure? for example, with minutes to go before a deadline? Here's a question to help you! Style up the motivational posters below.

## Add box-sizing: border-box to all elements
Use the asterisk: * { box-sizing: border-box; } but make sure it comes after any @import lines!

## The body element:
* set the background image to brick-tile.jpg;
* make all text white;
* set the font family to be the Google Font Montserrat (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat).
## Spans with class large:
make the font size 36 pixels;
set the display property to block
(spans are normally inline).
div elements:
set the background colour to rgb(193, 12, 6);
set the width to 190 pixels;
set the display property to inline-block
(divs are normally block);
make the text centre aligned;
add a padding of 10 pixels on all sides;
add a left margin of 10 pixels and top margin of 160 pixels.

The result should look like this:
