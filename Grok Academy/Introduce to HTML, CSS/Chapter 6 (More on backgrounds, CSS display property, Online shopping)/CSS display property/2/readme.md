# Cute as a button
Want to style up some social sharing buttons for your site?

FontAwesome provides a whole range of social icons you can use!

We've already set the **width** and **height** in the **fa** class, and the **background-color** using icon-specific classes (**fa-facebook**, **fa-twitter**, etc).

## Set box-sizing: border-box on all elements
* remember to use the * selector!
## Style the fa class:
* change the **display** property to **inline-block**
(notice how the **width** and **height** now work);
* set the bottom margin to 10 pixels;
* make the text white and centre aligned;
* set the top and bottom padding to 10 pixels;
## Now let's style these icons up differently!
the **circle** class should have a border radius of 18 pixels;
the **leaf** class should have a top right and bottom left border radius of 15 pixels;
the **tab** class should have their **display** property set to **block**, **width** of **200px** and a border radius of **5p**x.
The result should look like this:
