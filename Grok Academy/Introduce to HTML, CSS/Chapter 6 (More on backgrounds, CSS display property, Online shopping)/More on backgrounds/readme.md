# Snapchat
Snapchats wouldn't be nearly as funny without captions.

## Include the picture as a background image to your body element
* set the background image to snapcat.jpg
* turn off background repeat
## Style your caption (p element)
* make the width 360 pixels
* center align the text and make it white
* set the background colour to **rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)** (remember that this is black with 60% opacity)
* set the top and bottom padding to 8 pixels
* make the font family sans-serif
* add a top margin of 500 pixels

The result should look like this:
