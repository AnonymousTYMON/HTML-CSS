    <h1>Argleton Renaissance Faire</h1>
    <p>The Argleton Renaissance Faire is an annual event celebrating the Winter Solstice which this year's falls on June the 22nd. The local Argleton Primary School will be hosting the event all weekend, complete with artists, musicians, food, costumes and even a court jester in residence.</p>
    <p>
    This year's theme is festival of light! During the day our local circus society will be performing fire twirling, complete with workshops for kids wishing to learn (without fire) Poi and stick twirling skills. Once the sun goes down, we'll light the lanterns and set our eyes skyward at 9pm for a fantastic fireworks display.</p>
