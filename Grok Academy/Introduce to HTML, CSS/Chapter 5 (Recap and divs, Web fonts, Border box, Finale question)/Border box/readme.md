# Jack in a border-box
I've set this image of my jack-o-lantern to 200 pixels wide with a 20 pixel margin on all sides, and I want to keep it this way.

## Something is wrong!
I set the **width** for the container div to **200px** as well, but my picture is overflowing outside of the box! I need you to fix the **width** of the container so the picture fits.

## But first...
I also want to add a 23 pixel black border to the container div.

## Calculate the width
Change the **width** of the container div, so that the picture fits perfectly inside it with an equal amount of space on both sides.

The result should look like this:
